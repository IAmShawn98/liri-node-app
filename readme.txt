Hey Rudy, I just wanted to let you know that I wasn't quite able to finish this one in time. I got your message about my portfolio website on BCS also,
I stopped working on that to begin working on this project to try and get as much done as I could before the due date. I'm nearly done the liri bot,
and I should have my official portfolio done either tonight or before the end of the week.


One question - Am I still able to get my portfolio re-evaluated? I'm nearly finished it and it should be done before the end of the week.

I know this liri bot project requires some kind of video to present it, and sadly, since this project isn't 100% complete yet, I 
don't have any proof of progress besides my github repo. Once I finish liri (and it's nearly done) I will create that video.


Sorry for the lack of content here, I'm juggling both projects, both of which are nearing completion.

I'll slack you the video presentation for liri and give you a link to my git pages when the projects are finalized.
